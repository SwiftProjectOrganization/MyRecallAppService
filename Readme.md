> **Acknowledgement:** Derived from the example project in [Swift OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator).

## Purpose

MyRecallAppService is used as counterpart to [MyRecalAppClient](https://github.com/SwiftProjectOrganization/MyRecallAppClient) using the Swift OpenApi generator project to define the protocol.

The MyRecallAppClient IOS app is used to **test** exporting and importing a JSON representation of the MyRecallApp topics (SwiftData, in CloudKit) outside the IOS app sandbox.
